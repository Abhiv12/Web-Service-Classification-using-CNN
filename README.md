# 🌐 Web Service Classification using CNN

This project demonstrates the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying web services based on their WSDL files. The data is processed and transformed to train a deep learning model that can predict the service category.

## 🧠 Model Overview

A 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to classify the WSDL files into different web service categories. The model is trained on preprocessed data represented as numerical vectors.
